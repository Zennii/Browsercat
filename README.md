# Browsercat
A recreation of Monstercat's 2014 to early 2016 visual style in-browser.

This project is one year old, but I decided to post it here as some of the things I have accomplished may help someone. 
Contributions are welcome.

All important functionality happens in **js/mnstr_visualizer.js**

# Live Demo
I have a live demo on my site, here: http://monstercat.zenny3d.com/
